/*
since the implementation of ErrorReporting strongly depends on library and actual Google Cloud Project, the test is quite hard to implement.
one thing we can use to boost our confidence is that the library is well tested.
the test on the library can be seen in https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/master/errorreporting/errors_test.go
